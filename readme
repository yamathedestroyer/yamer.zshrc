yamer.zshrc

This is my personal zshrc with some shit I came up with over the 15 years I used it

Highlights are:

cpv and mvv:
Shell Functions which recursively copy/move directories with pv so progress is displayed. Synced writes arent implemented rn but will do it sometimes
Usage: "cpv/mvv SOURCE DESTINATION"

paste and paste-file:
allows directly pushing shit to a paste service (0x0.st in this case)
Usage: For paste just pipe output into it like "example-command | paste" and for paste-file: "paste-file example-file"

The rest is mostly opinionated configuration, suggestions are welcome but may or may not be ignored
